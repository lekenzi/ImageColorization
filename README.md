# ImageColorization

This project aims to provide a solution for colorizing black and white images using deep learning techniques.

## Description

ImageColorization is a Python-based project that utilizes deep learning models to automatically add color to black and white images. The project leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the mapping between grayscale and color images.

## Features

- Automatic colorization of black and white images
- Support for various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG)
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
- Customizable colorization options

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageColorization.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd ImageColorization
    ```

2. Run the colorization script:

    ```shell
    python colorize.py --input path/to/input_image.jpg --output path/to/output_image.jpg
    ```

    Replace `path/to/input_image.jpg` with the path to your black and white image, and `path/to/output_image.jpg` with the desired path for the colorized output image.
